To run in Linux terminal:
python3 ukf.py -D 3

A few notes: 
1.	This is an implementation of an Unscented Kalman Filter for orientation tracking of a drone
2.	It runs on three datasets supplied in the /imu directory (so you can input -D from 1 to 3)
3.	It's based on a paper included in this directory called ukf_paper.pdf
4.	The output includes 3 graphs of the ground truth and filtered roll, pitch, and yaw angles
5. 	No starter code was supplied for this project
